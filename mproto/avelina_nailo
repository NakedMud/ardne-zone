She wears traveling clothes of good quality - a forest green cloak \r\nover well-tailored leather garments. A small pack rests beside her chair, \r\nsuggesting she's a traveler passing through the village. Her graceful movements \r\nand cultured speech mark her as someone of education and refinement.\r\n"
