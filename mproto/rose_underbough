As a priestess \r\nof Savras, the god of divination, she has an otherworldly quality about her, \r\noften pausing mid-conversation as if listening to voices others cannot hear. \r\nShe wears simple gray robes marked with the all-seeing eye symbol of her deity, \r\nand carries a crystal-topped staff that occasionally glows with inner light. \r\nHer bare feet are typical of her halfling heritage, and she moves with quiet, \r\ncontemplative steps.\r\n"
