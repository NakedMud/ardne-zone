The air is filled with \r\nthe sounds of commerce: haggling voices, the ring of hammer on metal, and the \r\ncreak of wooden cart wheels. The street is shaded by large oak trees whose \r\nbranches stretch between the buildings. This bustling thoroughfare serves as the commercial heart of Ardne Village. \r\nShops and stalls line both sides of the cobblestone street, their colorful \r\nawnings and painted signs competing for attention.
