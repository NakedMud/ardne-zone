  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "The main entrance to Ardne Village, this reinforced wooden gate sees the \r\nmost traffic from merchants, travelers, and local farmers. Built into the \r\nvillage's protective earthen walls, the gate is flanked by watchtowers where \r\nguards keep vigilant watch over the approaches. A well-worn dirt road stretches \r\nsouth toward distant farmlands and other settlements. The gate itself is \r\nconstructed of heavy oak timbers bound with iron, designed to withstand both \r\nsiege and the daily wear of constant use. Village guards stationed here check \r\nincoming travelers and collect tolls from merchant caravans.\r\n"

  me.edesc("road", "The southern road is the village's main trade route, showing heavy wear from \r\nmerchant caravans, farm wagons, and livestock drives. Recent rains have left \r\ndeep muddy ruts that make travel challenging.\r\n")
