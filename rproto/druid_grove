Wildflowers carpet \r\nthe ground in a riot of colors - moonbell flowers with their silver petals, \r\ngolden sunburst blooms, and deep purple nightshade. A small spring bubbles up \r\nfrom the earth near the altar, its waters crystal clear and said to have healing \r\nproperties. Carved wooden totems depicting various forest animals stand sentinel \r\namong the trees. The air is thick with the scent of earth, growing things, and \r\nthe wild magic that flows through all natural places.\r\n"
