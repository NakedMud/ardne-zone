  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "This quiet residential street leads west from the town square past modest \r\ntimber-framed houses and small workshops. The cobblestones are well-maintained \r\nbut show less wear than the busier market areas. Small front gardens display \r\nvegetables and herbs, while laundry hangs from lines stretched between buildings. \r\nThe street has a peaceful, domestic atmosphere broken only by the occasional \r\nsound of a craftsman's hammer or the laughter of children playing in doorways.\r\n"
  
  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("houses", "Well-maintained timber-framed houses line the street, each with its own small \r\ngarden and workshop space. Most have their doors painted in bright colors - \r\nblue, green, red, and yellow - giving the street a cheerful appearance.\r\n")
  me.edesc("gardens", "Small front gardens show the practical nature of the residents - rows of \r\ncabbages, onions, and herbs rather than decorative flowers. Some have small \r\nchicken coops or rabbit hutches tucked into corners.\r\n")
  me.edesc("laundry", "Lines of drying laundry stretch between buildings, fluttering in the breeze. \r\nThe clothes are simple but well-mended, showing the practical nature of the \r\nvillage's working families.\r\n")
