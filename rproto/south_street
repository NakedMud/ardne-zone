The cobblestone street is wide enough for \r\nmerchant wagons and shows heavy wear from constant traffic. Buildings line both \r\nsides - a mix of shops, workshops, and residences with their upper stories \r\njutting out over the street. The sound of commerce fills the air: creaking \r\nwagon wheels, shouting merchants, and the general bustle of village life.\r\n"
