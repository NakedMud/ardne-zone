This sturdy wooden gate \r\nis built into the earthen fortifications, with a small guardhouse nearby for \r\nthe watch. The gate sees moderate traffic from local farmers, shepherds driving \r\ntheir flocks to pasture, and travelers taking the western route to avoid the \r\nmore dangerous northern road. A wooden bridge spans a small stream just outside \r\nthe gate, its planks worn smooth by countless feet and hooves.\r\n"

  me.edesc("guardhouse", "A small wooden structure serves as the guard post, though it's often empty during \r\ndaylight hours when the threat level is low. Simple furnishings and a weapon \r\nrack are visible through the open door.\r\n")
  me.edesc("bridge", "Just beyond the gate, a wooden bridge crosses a clear stream that flows around \r\nthe village's western edge. The bridge's planks are worn smooth and slightly \r\nbowed from years of use by carts, livestock, and foot traffic.\r\n")
