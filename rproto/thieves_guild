The stone walls are \r\nlined with shadows that seem to move independently of their sources. Lockpicks, \r\ndaggers, and other tools of the trade hang from pegs on the walls. A large table \r\ndominates the center, covered with maps of the village showing guard patrol \r\nroutes, merchant schedules, and potential marks. Oil lamps provide flickering \r\nillumination, creating dancing shadows perfect for clandestine meetings. The \r\nair smells of leather oil, steel, and the faint scent of danger.\r\n"
