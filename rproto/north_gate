  me.name       = "the north gate"
  me.terrain    = "City"
  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "This sturdy wooden gate reinforced with iron bands serves as the northern \r\nentrance to Ardne Village. The gate is set into simple wood and earth walls \r\nthat surround the settlement, providing basic defense against bandits and wild \r\nbeasts. A small guardhouse built into the wall houses the gate watch, while \r\nmurder holes above allow defenders to rain down arrows or boiling oil on \r\nattackers. Beyond the gate, a dirt road leads north toward the ominous castle \r\nruins that loom on the horizon. Two village guards stand at attention, checking \r\ntravelers and maintaining security.\r\n"
  
  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("gate", "The wooden gate is constructed of thick oak planks bound with iron bands and \r\nreinforced with metal studs. Heavy iron hinges allow it to swing open for \r\ntraffic, while a thick wooden bar can secure it from the inside during attacks.\r\n")
  me.edesc("walls", "The village walls are built of earth and timber in the traditional style - \r\nwooden posts driven deep into earthen ramparts, with a wooden palisade on top. \r\nWhile not as strong as stone, they provide adequate protection for a small village.\r\n")
  me.edesc("guardhouse", "A small wooden structure built into the wall serves as the guard post. Through \r\nits open door, you can see simple furnishings - a table, chairs, weapon racks, \r\nand a small brazier for warmth during cold nights.\r\n")
  me.edesc("road", "The dirt road leading north is well-traveled but shows signs of recent neglect. \r\nDeep ruts from wagon wheels are filled with muddy water, and the road disappears \r\ninto dark woods before emerging at the castle ruins.\r\n")
