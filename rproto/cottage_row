  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "This quiet residential lane houses several of the village's smaller dwellings. \r\nSmall timber-framed cottages line the cobblestone path, each with its own tiny \r\ngarden and distinctive character. Smoke rises from stone chimneys, and the air \r\ncarries the scent of cooking food and wood smoke. Laundry hangs from lines \r\nbetween the buildings, and small children can occasionally be seen playing in \r\nthe narrow spaces between houses. The atmosphere is peaceful and domestic, a \r\nwelcome respite from the busier commercial areas of the village.\r\n"
  
  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("cottages", "The cottages vary in style and construction - some are simple timber-frame \r\nstructures with thatched roofs, others are built of stone with tile roofing. \r\nEach shows the personality of its occupants through painted shutters, flower \r\nboxes, and small decorative touches.\r\n")
  me.edesc("gardens", "Tiny front gardens display a mix of practical vegetables and decorative flowers. \r\nMost have small herb patches near the kitchen doors, and some include fruit \r\ntrees or berry bushes.\r\n")
  me.edesc("path", "The narrow cobblestone path winds gently between the cottages, worn smooth by \r\ngenerations of residents. Small stones mark property boundaries, and the occasional \r\ncat can be seen sunning itself on the warm stones.\r\n")
  me.edesc("laundry", "Lines of washing stretch between some of the cottages, displaying the simple \r\nbut well-maintained clothing of working families. The clothes flutter gently in \r\nthe breeze, adding movement and life to the quiet lane.\r\n")
