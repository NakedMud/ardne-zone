  me.name       = "the east gate"
  me.terrain    = "City"
  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "This modest wooden gate provides access to the eastern approaches of Ardne \r\nVillage. Built into the earthen walls, it serves primarily for local traffic - \r\nfarmers heading to their fields, hunters returning from the woods, and the \r\noccasional merchant taking the less-traveled eastern route. A single guard \r\ntower overlooks the gate, though it's often unmanned during peaceful times. \r\nThe gate itself is simpler than the main southern entrance but still sturdy \r\nenough to provide security. Beyond lies a winding path that leads through \r\nrolling hills toward distant forests and smaller settlements.\r\n"
  
  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("gate", "A simple but sturdy wooden gate constructed of local oak, reinforced with iron \r\nbands. While not as elaborate as the main gates, it's well-built and maintained \r\nby the village's craftsmen.\r\n")
  me.edesc("tower", "A single wooden watchtower provides an elevated view of the eastern approaches. \r\nA bell hangs from its roof, ready to sound an alarm if danger approaches from \r\nthis direction.\r\n")
  me.edesc("path", "The eastern path winds through rolling hills covered in wildflowers and scattered \r\ngroves of trees. It's less traveled than the main roads but offers a peaceful \r\nroute for those seeking to avoid the busier trade routes.\r\n")
