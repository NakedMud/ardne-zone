The interior \r\ncontains a single bachelor-style room with a simple bed and wooden chest for \r\nstorage. In one corner, a small firepit flickers with a warm flame, providing \r\nboth heat and light. Bunches of dried fruit hang from the ceiling in long \r\nstrands, filling the air with their sweet, preserved scent.\r\n"
