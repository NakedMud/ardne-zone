  ### extra descriptions
  me.edesc("pillars", "Massive stone pillars support the temple's roof, each one carved with intricate \r\nsymbols of divination - all-seeing eyes, crystal spheres, star charts, and \r\nrunic prophecies. The carvings seem to shift slightly in the flickering light.\r\n")
  me.edesc("vines", "Thick green vines cover the exterior walls and roof, their leaves rustling with \r\nan almost sentient quality. Some say the vines whisper secrets to those who \r\nlisten carefully.\r\n")
  me.edesc("artworks", "Religious paintings and tapestries show Savras in his various aspects - as the \r\nAll-Seeing Eye, as a robed figure holding a crystal orb, and as a divine presence \r\nrevealing the threads of fate to mortal supplicants.\r\n")
  me.edesc("windows", "The shuttered windows can be opened to let in natural light, but most remain \r\nclosed to maintain the temple's mystical atmosphere. When light does filter through, \r\nit creates strange patterns on the floor.\r\n")
  me.edesc("orbs", "Crystal orbs of various sizes rest on marble pedestals, some glowing \r\nwith inner light, others swirling with mysterious mists.\r\n")
  me.edesc("charts", "Detailed star charts and astronomical diagrams cover the walls, \r\nmarked with prophetic annotations in multiple languages.\r\n")
