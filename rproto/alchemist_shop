Glass alembics, retorts, and \r\ndistillation apparatus line the shelves. The air is thick with the scent of \r\nherbs, sulfur, and mysterious brewing compounds. This mysterious shop is filled with the tools and ingredients of the \r\nalchemical arts. Glass vials and bottles line shelves along every wall, \r\ncontaining liquids of every color. A large work table dominates the center, \r\ncovered with bubbling apparatus and grinding equipment.\r\n"
