  me.desc       = me.desc + " " + "This plaster tower serves as the home of Baelitae Larson, a half-elf resident \r\nof the village. The brown shingled roof tops the cylindrical structure, while \r\na big brick chimney provides warmth and cooking facilities. The interior contains \r\na single bachelor-style room with a bed and chest, along with a dresser positioned \r\nagainst the far wall. In one corner sits a small firepit, now cold with only \r\nashes remaining. Bundles of cured meats hang from the rafters, their smoky scent \r\npermeating the air and providing sustenance through the lean months.\r\n"
